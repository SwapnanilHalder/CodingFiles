Accuracy of Linear Regression is :  86.21 %
Accuracy of Ridge Regression is :  86.21 %
Accuracy of Lasso Regression is :  86.21 %

--Simplest model gives the same output irrespective of testing data
Accuracy of Simplest Model is :  64.37 %



We have got the accuracy of all the regreesion model to be same as it may happen that by 
including regularization term doesn't increase the accuracy


In code we have iterated from 1 to 100 for lambdaa ( hyper-parameter ) to know for which lambda value we get the highest accuracy
And it turned out to be that keeping lambda = 0 goves the highest accuracy

For lambda = 0, Then both Ridge and Lasso regression is same as Linear regression
