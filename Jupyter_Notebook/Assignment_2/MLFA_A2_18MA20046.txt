- The score of the implemented model is 1.0 with a learning rate = 0.01 and iterations = 100

- The score for the logistic regression model from Sklearn is 1.0 with a learning rate = 0.01 and iterations = 1000

The score values change by changing the randomised state value in test_train_split function
