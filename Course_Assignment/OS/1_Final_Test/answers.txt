A) Round robin. 
Time quantum 10. 
Intervals when first job (arrival at t=0) is served :

Service time for first job is:
0-10 , 40-50 , 210-218

B) Multilevel feedback queue. Time quantum 10. 
Intervals when first job (arrival at t=0) is served :
Service time for first job is: 0-10, 200-210, 400-408

If the order of the process is KL
K gets V internal fragmentation 59(340-281)
L gets JU internal fragmentation 136(460-324)
Total internal fragmentation : 59+136 = 195


If the order of the process is LK
L gets V internal fragmentation 16(340-324)
K gets JU internal fragmentation 179(460-281)
Total internal fragmentation : 16+179 = 195

Initial: ur,kr,d,m,hr Referenced: y 
Step 1 : kr,d,m,hr,u
Step 2 : d,m,hr,u,k 
Step 3 : m,hr,u,k,yr

finally m,hr,u,k,yr holds
victim is d

2 sequences that are not possible now but were possible earlier :
LJMW, LJWM

(A) Programmed driven I/O:
Job  Ready  Service    Interval
U    0      60[80]47    0-187
V    10     90          187-277
During
60-140 => cpu is not doing any execution
 
(B) DMA:
Job     Ready      Service      Interval-CPU     Interval-Disk
U       0          60[80]47     0-60,150-197     60-70P,70-130 fetch data,130-140Q
V       10         90           60-150

During :
60-70 => disk picks information and P is executed
70-130 => disk operations
130-140 => information transferred from disk to main memory and Q is executed


6 =>
A)
max(A2-1,min(m, A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 - 4))

B)
max(A4-1,min(m, A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 - 4))



7 =>
cobegin
    begin  u=31+74  z=u*2  end -> Step 1
    begin  h=82*43  d=u/h  end -> Step 2
coend

Reason:
If Step 2 is executed before Step 1
then,  d=u/h -> garbage (u is not defined)

Each job needs 30 units of service.
case 1: Arrival of b at t=10.
Job  Arrival   RD     DL       ABC                ACB  
A      0       30     30    0-30 (Td 0 )      0-30 (Td  0)
B      10      43     53    30-60(Td 7)       60-90(Td 37)
C      10      40     50    60-90(Td 40)      30-60(Td 10)

                            total td=47       total td= 47
In this case, ABC and ACB both are equal. No one is better.

case 2: Arrival of b at t=30
Job     Arrival   RD    DL        ABC              ACB  
A          0      30    30    0-30 (Td  0)     0-30 (Td  0)
B          30     43    73    30-60(Td  0)     60-90(Td 17)
C          10     40    50    60-90(Td 40)     30-60(Td 10)

                              total td=40       total td=27

In this case, ACB is better.
