Question 1: Show RAM and transfer in following. RAM capacity 2 pages.
Use FIFO replacement.
g=47       
print(h)   
print(i)   
print(c)   


Disk(D)     
a=45  b=87  page:u 4587
c=29  d=92  page:v 2992
e=43  f=35  page:w 4335
g=94  h=82  page:y 9482
i=84  j=28  page:z 8428
Do as in following example
print(b) 4587:D->R                u4587
e=83      nil                     u4587,w83gh
a=42      nil                     u4287,w83gh
print(c) 2992:D->R 4287:R->D      w83gh,v2992

Question 2: Show execution of jobs in following
A [run  5][g][run 73][h]
B [run 20][g][run 50][h]
C [run 53][g][run 42][h]
D [run 94][g][run 15][h]
initial i is 0
g:i++; if i>2 {z[i-2]=id; stop;}
h:i--; if i>1 signal(z[i-1])

Example:
G [run  0][w][run 10][s]
H [run  2][w][run  5][s]
K [run  8][w][run  7][s]
L [run 12][w][run  2][s]
w:i++; if i>1 {z[i-1]=id; stop;}
s:i--; if i>0 signal(z[i])
G: run0-0 t=0i=1  run0-10  t=10 i=2 signalKz[2]
H: run0-2 t=2i=2  z[1]=H stop run19-24 t=24i=0
K: run0-7 t=7i=3  z[2]=K stop run10-17 t=17i=2 signalLz[2]
L: run0-12t=12i=3 z[2]=L Stop run17-19 t=19i=1 signalHz[1]

Question 3: Write code of (12823 zero)1(6457 zero)1(23 zero)1(22 zero)
Block size 64.
Complete block zero is 0.
Single one in block 10<addr>
More one's in block 11<block>
Show method as shown following. No marks without method.
Example: (459 zero)1(405 zero)1(7 zero)1(22 zero)
(7*64zero)[(11zero)1(52zero)](320 zero)[(33 zero)1(7 zero)1(22 zero)]
code: (7 zero)(10001011)(5 zero)(11)(33 zero)(1)(7 zero)(1)(22 zero)

Question 4:Find related words for A)Dynamic partitioning B)Static partitioning  C)Paging  D)SRTN E)C-Scan F)SSTF
Write answer in following form
C-Scan={Least waiting, Internal fragmentation, hole}. A word can come in more than one set.
Choose from following: Hole, Best fit, Best fit only, Worst fit, Least waiting,
Internal fragmentation, External fragmentation, Table fragmentation,
Inverted table, Pre-emption, Compaction, Starvation.
SSTF : Shortest seek time first in disk scheduling.
Let location of job A, B, C, D be 45,70,47,34 respectively. Their ready time are 0, 41,42,43 respectively.
Job A is served at t=45. Now head is at location 45. C is nearest to 45. 47-45=2 70-45=25 45-34=11.
Job C is served at t=47. Now D is nearest to head. 47-34<70-47. D is served at 60 and B at t=96.
Compaction is following: Job A is allocated memory 10-19. Memory 0-9 and 20-29 free.
Job B needs 15 unit memory. Job A is transferred to 0-9. Now 10-29 is free.
Job B can be allocated. It is called memory compaction.
Starvation is following: Job A, B, C, ... arrive at t=0, 2, 4, 6, .... Service time of job A and B is 10 each. Service time of others is 2 each. In shortest job first A is served 0-10. C 10-12, D 12-14, E 14-16 and so on. Job B is never served. It is called starvation of B. Because B is never served
