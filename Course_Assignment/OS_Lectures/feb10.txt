Method of password.
Users  Password   CP  ZKP
Anil    17        39
Dipu    8         21
Gyan    29        63
Hari    8         21
Jalaj   5              189
How to give security to password. Do not store password. Store coded password.
coding scheme is 2P+5 (CP). Let some one knows coded passwd of Anil 39.
He can not know origional password until coding scheme is known.
Zero knowledge password.
Coding scheme P^3+7P+29
Let P=5   125+35+29=189 is coded passwd.
Even after knowing coding scheme and coded password the actual pasword can not be obtained.
When someone wants to login. He will give password. The claimed password will be coded under given scheme. 
If code matches with coded passwd then enrty permitted.
When someone forgets password.
Coding scheme satisfies following
1) Coding is easy.
2) Decoding in general is hard.
3) Decoding is easy for the designer of coding scheme.

Let coding scheme is 187P+59.
Password 7. Coded pasword: 7*187+59=1309+59=1368.

To know actual password (1368-59)/187 is done.
x*y is easy   z/y is hard.
Any person can not  do division by 187.
How System Administrator will do decoding when
some user forgets password.
He divides by 17 and 11.
1368/17=80
80/11=7.
OS stores 187P+59.
Admistrartor know 187=17*11.

How factors of 187 are known to Administrator only.

Administrator took a and b two primes.
K=a*b is done by him.
In OS K is stored. coded password is stored.
Division by K is hard.
Administrator can easily divide by K by dividing by a and b.
conclusion: Getting factor of a number is not easy.
Getting a number whose factors are known is easy.
