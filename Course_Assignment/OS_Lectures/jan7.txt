a.c: pqwswasdfrghwsxcfgh
t.txt: zxswertdy
rty:cqardfthtrewr
The above is logical
Following is physical
Dir: a.c:0-18   t.txt:19-27   rty:28-40

The directory stores locations over which data is stored.
The above was continuous storage.
Following is non continuous block structure.
Directory:
a.c:0,4,2,6     t.txt:3,5     rty:7,1,8
0:pqwsw  1:fthtr   2:ghwsx   3:zxswe  4:asdfr
5:rtdy   6:cfgh    7:cqard   8:ewr    9: 
A) Let 3rd letter of file t.txt is deleted: 3:zxse
B) Let 8th letter of file a.c is inserted as m
Block4:asdmfr Hence block 4 is made in 2 parts
Block4:asd  Block9:mfr
Here a.c was in logical blocks pqwsw,asdfr,ghwsx,cfgh
It becomes as pqwsw,asd,mfr,ghwsx,cfgh
Block size 5. Each block has 3 to 5 letters.
When it has 6 letters it splits.
When it has 2 letters then it takes one/all letters of neighbour.
Initial qwe,asdf,hcm,aqwer,hyc
A) Insert 4th letter as h: qwe,ahsdf,hcm,aqwer,hyc
B) Delete 2nd letter qw,asdf,hcm,aqwer,hyc
It is modified as qwa,sdf,hcm,aqwer,hyc [transfer]
C) Insert 11th letter as z. qwe,asdf,hcm,azqwer,hyc 
It is modified as qwe,asdf,hcm,azq,wer,hyc [split]
Initial qwe,rty,hcmyd,tud
A) Delete 0th letter  we,rty,hcmyd,tud
It is modified as  werty,hcmyd,tud  [merge]
B) Delete 4th letter qwe,ry,hcmyd,tud
It is modified as qwery,hcmyd,tud [merge]
It can also be qwe,ryh,cmyd,tud [transfer]
