ASSIGNMENT You have to create following modules in any high level language that accomplish the task of reading one 8086 assembly language instruction and verify whether the instruction is syntactically correct or not: Lexer (abstract object). The Lexer object is a lexical analyzer. It reads the sequence of characters that comprises an assembly language source code instruction, and converts it into a sequence of tokens. Parser (abstract object). The Parser object is a syntactic analyzer. It accepts the sequence of tokens generated by the Lexer object, and verifies that the sequence is a syntactically valid assembly language instruction. Assume that instruction set consists of ADD and SUB only.
