Question 1: Write smallest program to print U      G. It is U(6 blank)G
Use only Mov, Int.

Question 2: The following program prints ABCDEF What is missing line. One missing line.
answer format mov bx,t  here t=12 or t>=67
.MODEL SMALL
.CODE
mov dl,65
<one missing line>
L:CMP DL,70
JG L1
MOV AH,2
INT 33
ADD DL,1
LOOP L
L1:MOV AH,76
INT 33
END

Question 3: Write formula for m/c code for Mov x,y where x,y are registers 
AH,AL,BH,BL,CH,CL,DH,DL
Hint formula for mov x,y where x register and y number is (176+g(x))(y)
Here g(AL)=0 ... g(BH)=7

Question 4: g value of AL is 0. BH is 7. Write g value of others.
